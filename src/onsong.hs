{-
This program reads a .onsong file and converts each line to HTML.
The two methods used are by simple Text manipulations and by Parsing 
various lines with Text.Parsec.
For an exaple of how the .onsong file should look like see the file
(./examples/example.onsong) some things might work out of the box as
extras but some things You will probably need to add yourself :)
